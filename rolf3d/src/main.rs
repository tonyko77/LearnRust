//! ROLF3D - a Rust implementation of the WOLF3D raycasting engine :)

  TODO - implementation steps for ROLF3D:
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    * Map investigations:
        - What is the meaning of each WALL and THING word, in the map arrays ?!?
        - Is plane #3 really used/needed? and is it really empty for ALL maps in WL1/WL6/SOD ??

    * Automap:
        - display walls/doors etc using actual graphics
        - display things using actual graphics

    * Movement on the Automap:
        - turn and strife
        - mouse horizontal turn
        - mouse buttons
        - collision detection (with walls)

    * 3D View / Raycaster
        - floor + correct ceiling color
        - walls and doors
        - sprites (actors, decorations)
        - movement through the 3D world

    * Gameplay
        - key handling (e.g. Tab = Automap)
        - open doors !!

    * (IS THIS NEEDED ?) identify PIC indexes based on game type (WL1, WL6, SOD, SDM)
        - seems to matter only if I want to reproduce EXACTLY the original game

    * Enemy AI
        - shoot/knife enemies

    * (Almost) Full Game:
        - NO sound :/
        - Menu system (may be simplified)

  DONE:
  ~~~~~
    * basic painting via ScreenBuffer
    * load palette from GAMEPAL.OBJ + hardcode it + display it
    * load maps and sketch them (just colored rectangles, for now)
    * load graphics assets: VSWAP (flats and sprites) + VGAGRAPH (fonts and pics)
    * test-paint gfx assets - use <Tab> to switch between automap and Gfx
    * draw text

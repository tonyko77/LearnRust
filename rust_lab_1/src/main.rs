//===========================================================================================================
// You are playing hide and seek with your family in a forest. But you and your family have super powers.
// So it's not normal hide and seek, its hide and seek with explosions! It's your turn to hide,
// and your little brother's turn to see. In order to seek you he shoots random explosions at you until
// he finds you and hits you 3 times. Your brother goes and stands on a cliff overlooking the forest
// to get a better view and the games begin!
//
// Problem
//    Your brother can see the entire forest, a 5 x 5 grid, and knows that you are hiding somewhere in there.
//    He decides to fire off explosions at random spots in the forest. Maybe he'll hit you, maybe he won't.
//    Either way, he has a limited amount of energy can only fire off 36 explosions before his turn is over.
//    But, if your brother hits you 3 times then he will win and get to choose what to eat for dinner.
// You must simulate this duel, and print the result of who wins at the end.
//
// Other Rules
//  * You will hide in the same spot until he is hit. If you are hit you will jump to a new random spot in the forest.
//  * Every turn your brother must choose a new random spot to launch an attack on.
//  * Your sister is also hiding in a random spot in the forest. If your brother hits her,
//    your brother becomes frozen and loses three explosions. Your sister will never move.
//  * You and your sister cannot be in the same spot.
//  * At the beginning of each round output a visual of the forest.
//    "_" marks a tree 'Y' marks yourself, 'S' marks your sister.
//  * After each round (your brother's explosion) output whether he hit, who he it or if he missed,
//    as well as the location of the attack.
//  * Also after each round output your remaining stamina, and your brother's remaining explosions.
//  * Once either you are out of stamina or your brother is out of explosions the contest is over.
//    Print the winner followed by 'Time for dinner!'
//
// Challenges:
//  * Use Clap to generate a CLI for this simulation that allows the user to change the initial parameters
//    of the simulation, such as grid size, your brothers's stamina, how many sisters you have, etc.
//  * Wanna work ahead of where we are in the book? Create a Forest object to represent
//    the game's current state and implement the Display trait.
//  * Add some unit tests! I get that unit testing is kind of odd in programs that use RNG but if you design
//    your functions cleverly you can get around that. Note that you can test private functions in rust.
//===========================================================================================================

// TODO:
//  * I didn't think of using a "sparse" representation of the forest => REFACTOR
//  * Create a Forest object to represent the game's current state and implement the Display trait.
//  * Add doc comments + QUIZ: generate cargo docs and view their website
//  * Use Clap to generate a CLI for this simulation ....
